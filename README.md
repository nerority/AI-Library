# AI Portfolio - Devin Pellegrino (In Progress)

Welcome to my AI Portfolio, a comprehensive collection of projects and research endeavors in the field of AI. Dive in to explore my groundbreaking work in semantic knowledge structures, advanced AI assistance, system design methods, self-instruct frameworks, problem-solving algorithms, and more.

## Projects and Research

### JSON/Natural Language Hybrid Prompts ‚Äê The Best Prompting Method
At the start of my journey with mastering prompt engineering, I found a new way to prompt that was pretty much superior in every single way. With the release of GPT-4 Code Interpretor, the benefits of this method have risen to new heights. I believe this is best possible way to prompt an AI model, and will show you exactly why. See [here](https://github.com/nerority/Portfolio/wiki/1.-JSON-Natural-Language-Hybrid-Prompts-%E2%80%90-The-Best-Prompting-Method) for more information. 

### Semantic Knowledge Structures for Advanced AI Assistance

My work in this area is centered around enhancing the capabilities of AI assistance. I delve into the construction of semantic knowledge structures to enable nuanced understanding and response generation in AI systems.

- **AI Exploration Guide V1.0**: An intuitive guide that incorporates various AI methodologies, principles, and frameworks to form a comprehensive approach to AI exploration. The guide is designed to tackle a wide range of AI-related tasks and scenarios, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and seasoned AI enthusiasts. Check it out [here](insert-link-here).

### Problem-Solving Algorithms

I focus on developing sophisticated algorithms capable of addressing complex problems in the AI domain.

- **QIHDS (Quantum-Informed Hyper-Dimensional Synergy) Algorithm**: An advanced algorithm that integrates Quantum Probabilistic Reasoning, Complexity Navigation, Higher-order Logic, and Meta Rule Generation. It is designed to solve complex problems and generate innovative solutions. Learn more about it [here](insert-link-here).

- **Semantic Learning Algorithms**: A set of algorithms aimed at enhancing the learning capabilities of AI systems. These algorithms leverage the principles of semantic knowledge representation and semantic learning to facilitate efficient and effective knowledge acquisition and utilization in AI systems.
